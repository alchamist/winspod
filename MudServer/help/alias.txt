Aliases can be created to execute one or more commands with one user-created command.

Eg:

^HAlias hi say hi everyone^N

would create a user command of "hi" that when executed will produce

^HYou say "hi everyone"^N

Multiple commands can be executed by using a semi-colon to seperate the commands.

Eg:

Alias Hi say Hi everyone;tf Hi mates

When executed would produce

You say "Hi everyone"
You tell your friends "Hi mates"


^RSee "Alias 2" for more information

^RRestrictions:^N

Aliases can only contain system commands, not other aliases.
