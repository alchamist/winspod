There are some special characters you can use in your aliases:

%0 - This will insert any text in the stack added when executing the alias

%1 - This will insert one word from the front of the stack, and remove that
     word from the stack.

So 

Alias waveto remote %1 waves to you and says "%0"

Typing "waveto Slim morning mate" Would produce

You emote to Slim: Alchamist waves and says "morning mate"


^RSee "Alias 3" for more information

Aliases can only contain system commands, not other aliases.
