^RChannels^N

Channels are there to allow players who share an interest to chat without having to use mutli-tells or go to another room. Channels can only be created by the admin, and only the owner can allow a player to join a channel.

To use a channel, either find the channel name or the number off of "cclist"

eg, channel 0 is the "techie" channel

to see who is listening on this channel, use "ccwho techie" or "ccwho 0"

Then to chat on the channel use the following commands:

^Hcu <channel> <message>^N - channel say
^Hce <channel> <action>^N - channel emote
^Hcs <channel> <song>^N - channel sing
^Hct <channel> <thought>^N - channel think

If the channels are getting a little much, you can mute all channels with the "ccmute" command
